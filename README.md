Academic project done with Endrit Nazifi and Luca Lucchina.

We developed a pipeline to achieve the task of making the agent land safely, the popular Reinforcement Learning benchmark.
We started with simple and naive agents, to then move to agents that employed Deep Q Networks. Several variations have been tried: Dueling DQNs, Double DQNs, Noisy Linear DQNs and more.
